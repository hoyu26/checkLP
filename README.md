The file checkLP(t,m,n).m2 is used to check whether QQ[X_1, X_mn]/in(I_t) and QQ[X_1, X_mn]/I_t have the weak/ strong Lefschetz property, while checkLPinI(t,m,n).m2 is only used to check whether QQ[X_1, X_mn]/in(I_t) has the weak/ strong Lefschetz property. If we only need to check QQ[X_1, X_mn]/in(I_t), using C2.m2 is faster.


Usage:
checkLP(t,m,n)

Inputs:
t,m,n, three positive integers

Outputs:
whether QQ[X_1, X_mn]/in(I_t) and QQ[X_1, X_mn]/I_t have the weak/ strong Lefschetz property


Usage:
checkLPinI(t,m,n)

Inputs:
t,m,n, three positive integers

Outputs:
whether QQ[X_1, X_mn]/in(I_t) has the weak/ strong Lefschetz property
